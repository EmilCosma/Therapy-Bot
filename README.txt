With a passion for both technology and helping people, I developed a chat bot therapist in C++ using the SFML library. Throughout the project, I delved deeper into the syntax of C++ and gained a stronger understanding of how to divide my code into multiple files. By utilizing SFML, I was able to create an intuitive interface that allowed users to easily interact with the bot.

Through the use of advanced algorithms, the chat bot therapist is able to analyze user input and provide appropriate responses to a variety of issues. Whether it be problems with family, love, work, or school, the bot can provide personalized advice to help users work through their challenges.

Overall, this project was an exciting opportunity to further develop my skills in C++ programming and problem-solving, while also making a positive impact on people's lives.
